        <p>TOSCA specification allows definition of a cloud application by defining a set of nodes that are connected to other using relationships.</p>

<p>In order to improve reusability of components and defined recipes, TOSCA allow the definition of NodeTypes that defines components and eventually their implementation (for example a Java NodeType and the script implementation to install it on a virtual server). The defined NodeTypes can then be reused when a developer or application architect want to define the topology of a cloud application.</p>

<div class="note info">
<p>TOSCA and thus Alien 4 Cloud allows you to define some abstract types (basically meta-types without implementation). This allows of course to dissociate the specific technical implementations from the actual definition of a component (writing an abstract Java node and several implementations with chef, puppet etc.).</p>

<p>This can also be leveraged in order to meta-model your applications for the cloud even if you don’t need to deploy them right now. Alien 4 Cloud advisory features for moving to the cloud leverage this to quiclky map your Information System and get feedback on your application’s cloud maturity and migration advisory.</p>
</div>

<p>The sub-sections details how you can write your own Capability Types, Node Types and Relationship Types to extends the one that Alien 4 Cloud already provides to you.</p>

<div class="note info">
<p>Definition of Node Types and other elements in TOSCA should be done in a definition file and packaged in a <a href="#/documentation/1.0.0/concepts/tosca.html">Cloud Service Archive</a></p>
