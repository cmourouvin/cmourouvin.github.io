        <p>In Alien 4 Cloud every deployment is done on what we call a <em>Cloud</em>. Clouds are used to describe a logical deployment target that offers a set of resources (e.g. machines, storage, network, firewalls etc.). A cloud may refer to a real <em>cloud</em>, to a specific <em>tenant on a cloud</em>, to a <em>set of physical machines</em> (BYON), or even <em>docker</em> containers.</p>

<div class="note info">
<p>You can create and configure as many clouds as you like to have as many deployment targets (environments) as required.</p>
</div>

<p>For example a cloud can refer to an Amazon configuration using a specific account while another cloud could be configured to work on a specific Tenant on an OpenStack cloud.</p>

<p>To make it simple a cloud is a logical set of available resources that Alien 4 Cloud can use to deploy applications. In order to do so A4C relies on orchestration technologies that are easily pluggable.</p>

<div class="note">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>We are currently supporting the opensource orchestrators cloudify 2 and cloudify 3 (Full re-written engine with new DSL - much better and flexible but that we felt prior to the up-comming 3.2 a bit light for production use).</p>
</div>

<div class="note info">
<h5>Role and security</h5>
<p>Only a user with the global ADMIN role can define, configure, enable and grant deployment role to other users or groups on a cloud.</p>
</div>

<p>To find more on clouds and how to configure them in Alien 4 Cloud please look at the <a href="deadlink">Getting started</a> guide if you don’t already have an Alien instance running and at the <a href="deadlink">cloud setup guide</a> in order to learn cloud configuration.</p>

<p>A <em>cloud</em> supported the following resources :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compute: TOSCA node who represents a real or virtual machine or ‘server’</li>
  <li>Storage: TOSCA node who represents a server-local block storage device</li>
  <li>Availability zone: Alien feature to separate your node into separate geographic area</li>
  <li>Network:  Alien feature based on the TOSCA expressiveness to control the mapping of software component to the network</li>
</ul>
